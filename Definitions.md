> OOB, or Out-of-Band, uses an external means of communication to exchange some information used in the pairing process. The OOB media could be any other wireless communication standard which can carry the corresponding information for pairing, like NFC or QRCode.

 > Bonding is the exchange of long-term keys after pairing occurs, and storing those keys for later useâ€”it is the creation of permanent security between devices. Pairing is the mechanism that allows bonding to occur.
